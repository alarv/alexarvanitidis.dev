In the tech industry, there's a heavy emphasis on performance, especially for those holding senior roles. But what about the emotional and psychological well-being of these experienced professionals? Imposter syndrome, a feeling of inadequacy despite one's accomplishments, is often amplified when there's an absence of positive reinforcement.

## ü§î A Common Misconception in Tech
There's a misleading idea circulating: senior professionals, because of their (possibly) high salary and depth of experience, should be almost flawless. This not only undermines their humanity but also overlooks the immense value they bring to their organisations. Their strategic insights can shape a company's long-term direction.

## üìñ A Personal Anecdote
To shed light on this issue, here's an anecdote from my experience in one of the companies I worked for. In one of my first roles with senior responsibilities, I thought I was doing great. Yet, for a year, I was kept in the dark with zero feedback. This experience sank my self-esteem to an all-time low and filled my days with doubts about my performance.

Things finally shifted during my performance review a year later. Despite entering the room with rock-bottom self-esteem, I was surprised with a 20% raise and told me they were excited about my performance. Even more astonishing, an extra 50% hike came a week later. This validation was gratifying, but it made me wonder why such vital emotional and professional feedback had been missing all along.

## ‚öôÔ∏è The Right People for Reviews
When it comes to performance reviews, it's essential to have them conducted by individuals who actually understand your role and contributions. Measuring one's value solely based on results misses the nuances and complexities of the job.

## üì¢ A Plea to Employers
Employers, please take this to heart: your team members are not just task-completion machines. They are human beings, experiencing life‚Äôs ups and downs. Emotional well-being ought to be at the top of your priority list if you aim for a productive, happy workforce.

## üîö Conclusion
In summary, a balanced work environment is about more than just achieving project goals or offering competitive salaries. Emotional well-being should be a part of the equation, and this applies to everyone, regardless of their rank or seniority.
